# Get your weird anniversary

## getWiredAnniversary

For example, you want to know when you will be 30 years, 30 months and 30 days old. You can pass your date of birth and the year, month and day that you want to calculate into the function, for example
````
getWiredAnniversary(new Date('1995-11-29'), 30, 30, 30)
```` 
which means that you want to find out when you will be 30 years, 30 months and 30 days

Good luck, and don't forget to celebrate your weird anniversary
